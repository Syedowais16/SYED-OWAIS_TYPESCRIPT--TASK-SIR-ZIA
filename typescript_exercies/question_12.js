// QUESTION NO 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
//                         0         1         2           3
var names = ["okasha", "ahmed", "akbar", "murtaza"];
// now for our ease we use for loop to iterate because our message is same
for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log("hi mr " + names[i] + " welcome to generative AI course arranged by governor sindh Kamran Tessori");
}
